Extending Tidypics
-----------------------------------

*** DISPLAYING THE LATEST PHOTOS ***
In tidypics/lib/tidypics.php, there is a function tp_get_latest_photos().
It can be used to display the site-wide latest photos or an individual
user's latest photos. The documentation explains how you could use that
function to display the latest photos on your front page if you are using
the custom front page tutorial plugin from Curverider.
