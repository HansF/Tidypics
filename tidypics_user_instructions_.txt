--------------------------------------------
Tidypics Photo Gallery plugin version 1.05
Release #5.
Release Date: October 27, 2008
--------------------------------------------

Installation
------------------
1. Drop into root/mod/ 
2. Enable plugin via admin panel.
3. Done



Requirements
------------------------
Will function with all versions of elgg, but current SVN build is needed
for consistency.
Reason: 
Updating the album access persmissions will auto-update the access for all
images contained in the album, but when updating each image entity, 
the metadata for that entity also needs to be updated. The function that accomplishes
this is only in the current SVN build.
If you do not use the current SVN build of elgg, you will likely get incorrectly
synced access permissions. Just wait for elg 1.1 and all will be dandy.
No changes need to be made to tidypics since the function is called via hook.



Recorded problems:
----------------------------
1.	when viewing an individual album, the image gallery displayed is a collection
	of floated divs. If pagination is enabled the bottom pagination bar does not 
	clear the floated images and you will get a messy display.  I did not yet
	research a better way to create a gallery view while being inline with elggs listing functions.
	
2.	The delete action does not delete any actual .
	The current method should work, but it does not. 
	I am quite sure this is unintended, but we will have to wait till the core 
	gets updated. 
	Currently NO IMAGES will ever be deleted from your serverspace.

3.	The groups view is a little odd because all other content like blogs, pages, are in list view.
	I refuse to put albums in list view, so if you want that, sorry! (just steal the list view from object/albums.php)
	

Cost to use this plugin: 
----------------------------------

	Participation in the tidypics group on community.elgg.org
	
	We need:
	------------------------
	1. User testing
	2. Bug reports
	3. Functionality, usability, feature requests/discussions
	4. Developers: Feature enhancements.

	If you do not pay the advertised cost of tidypics, you are stealing this plugin!
	Don't be a taker!!
	
	Bye!
