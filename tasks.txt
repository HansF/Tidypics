 --------- CAVEATS -----------
 

 -> SOLVED -- (just clear the pagination css class) problem: 
 when viewing an indie album, the images are floated. 
 if the pagination is enabled the bottom bar does not clear the 
 floated images
 
Problem:
the delete action does not delete any actual images
the current method should work, but it doesnt
look for clues in engine/lib/filestore.php
when deleting an album, easy way to delete all images
is just to find the albums folder and delete it.

Problem: 
when defining covers for album , i need to edit the input/checkboxes view
in order submit correctly. Remove the [] as part of the name

--------------------
my differences due to theme
------------------------
My customizations:

in the controls i am added to submenu
edit this out when packaging

 -> if i add album actions to submenu i lose "js confirm" on delete 
 -> change the album access permissions for groups to have 
	only 3 choices (logged in , everyone, or group only)
